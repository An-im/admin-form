# 📝 Admin Form (Practice Project)

This is a simple and responsive administrative form built with **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

It allows users to fill in details like name, email, phone number, position, and department. Submitted entries are stored locally in the browser and displayed in a table with the option to delete them.

The main goal of this project was to practice building a user interface that handles form validation, local storage, and dynamic DOM updates — all styled with utility-first CSS using Tailwind.
